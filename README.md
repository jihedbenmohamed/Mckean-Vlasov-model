# Mckean-Vlasov-model
Stochastic local Volatility model
• Exploration of regularization techniques in the singular local stochastic volatility models of McKean-Vlasov, using the
Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space approach to establish both existence and uniqueness of the solution.
• Model calibration by employing the most liquid market option prices.
• Innovative approach development for the McKean-Vlasov model, incorporating a neural network-based method to
enhance the regularization.
